        <p style="margin: 20px;">Looking for pet toys? Your pooch can happily choose from shelves of toys, which include plush or squeaky toys, hard chew ones and interactive playthings. Apart from their assortment of dog foods (everything from regular pedigree to protein-based wellness foods), they have different kinds of beds (crate mats, flat mats, cushions, donut beds) in funky designs and travel crates as well. So much for your first class ticket, human! Also popular among their customers are the baked goodies they offer – meatloaf cakes (with cream cheese frosting), carrot cakes, chicken liver cookies, mutt-balls (good ol’ meatballs) and lollipups (aka lollipops) made with chicken, carrot or apple. Given the added benefit of helpful suggestions and advice from the couple, we aren’t surprised they get customers from other cities even!</p>

        <h4 style="margin-left: 10px;">Puppy Love</h4>
        <p style="margin: 20px;">Inspired by the thought of giving the best for their pet dogs (Cookie and Pudding), Ridhima Coelho and Sandeep Atmaram started Paws The Pet Store way back in 2008, when the pet care industry was still in a nascent stage. While they did get a good share of puzzled looks from people, it didn’t take long for pet parents to warm up to their store. Be it at their charming flagship store on Markham Road or the smaller branch on Indiranagar, they encourage customers to shop along with their pets. The store also stocks products for cats and smaller animals like rabbits, hamsters and guinea pigs.</p>

              Pet food is among the most highly regulated of all food categories in the United States, including at both the federal and state levels. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates both finished pet food products (including treats and chews) and their ingredients. Nearly all states also require products sold therein to be registered, and for their labels to adhere to strict requirements regarding product names and ingredients.
              An ingredient cannot be used in pet food until it has been accepted by the FDA and/or adopted by the Association of American Feed Officials (AAFCO), the organization of state regulatory officials that develops model regulations for pet food and animal feed that can be included in state law.

              Where and how pet food is stored can make a big difference in keeping food safe for cats and dogs. Before purchasing or opening a package of pet food, examine the package closely to ensure there are no tears or damages. Unopened wet and dry pet food should be stored in a cool, dry location indoors, and kept off garage floors.
              Washing pet food storage containers between each bag of food is a helpful way to remember to check for damage and insect activity. When possible, store dry food in the original bag and within a plastic or metal bin with a lid. Wet or fresh food can be covered and stored in the refrigerator according to label guidelines.
